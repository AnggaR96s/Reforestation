## Mahatma Gandhi, as you know, walked barefoot most of the time, which produced an impressive set of calluses on his feet. 
## He also ate very little, which made him rather frail and with his odd diet, he suffered from bad breath. 
## This made him a super calloused fragile mystic hexed by halitosis.
